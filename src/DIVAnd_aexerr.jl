# Input: same as for DIVAndrun

* `mask`: binary mask delimiting the domain. true is inside and false outside. For oceanographic application, this is the land-sea mask.

* `pmn`: scale factor of the grid. pmn is a tuple with n elements. Every
       element represents the scale factor of the corresponding dimension. Its
       inverse is the local resolution of the grid in a particular dimension.

*  `xi`: tuple with n elements. Every element represents a coordinate
  of the final grid on which the observations are interpolated

* `x`: tuple with n elements. Every element represents a coordinate of
  the observations

* `f`: value of the observations *minus* the background estimate (m-by-1 array).
    (see note)

* `len`: correlation length

* `epsilon2`: error variance of the observations (normalized by the error variance of the background field). `epsilon2` can be a scalar (all observations have the same error variance and their errors are decorrelated), a vector (all observations can have a difference error variance and their errors are decorrelated) or a matrix (all observations can have a difference error variance and their errors can be correlated). If `epsilon2` is a scalar, it is thus the *inverse of the signal-to-noise ratio*.

# Optional input arguments specified as keyword arguments also as for DIVAnd


# Output:

* `aexerr`: the almost exact error

* `Bref`: the background error for error scaling by background `aexerr./Bref`

* `fa`: the analysis (with low impact fake data): DO NOT USE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING

* `sa`: the associated structure

Compute a variational analysis of arbitrarily located observations to calculate the almost exact error
