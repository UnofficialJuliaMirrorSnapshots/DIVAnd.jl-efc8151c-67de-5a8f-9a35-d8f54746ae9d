# Creates a list of windows for subsequent domain decomposition
# Also calculates already the subsampling steps `csteps` for the preconditionners

# Input:

* `Lpmnrange`: for every dimension the minimum and maximum correlation length scaled by the local resolution (i.e. the product between L and pm (pn,...))
* `gridsize`: number of points in each direction (size(mask))
* `latercsteps`: coarsening steps used later if a lower resolution model is used for preconditioning.
* `moddim`: modulo for cyclic dimension (vector with n elements). Zero is used for non-cyclic dimensions.

# Output:

* `stepsize`: spatial (and temporal) shift in grid points between subdomains for every dimension (?)
* `overlapping`: number of overlapping grid points for every dimension
* `isdirect`: true is the direct solver is activated
