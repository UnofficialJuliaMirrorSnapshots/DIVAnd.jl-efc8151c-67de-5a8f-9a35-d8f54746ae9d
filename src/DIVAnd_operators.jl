# Generate the gradient and Laplacian operators.
#
# s = DIVAnd_operators(mask,pmn,nu,iscyclic)
#
# Form sparse matrices representing the gradient and Laplacian using
# finite differences
#
# Input:
#   mask: binary mask delimiting the domain. 1 is inside and 0 outside.
#         For oceanographic application, this is the land-sea mask.
#   pmn: scale factor of the grid.
#   nu: diffusion coefficient of the Laplacian
#
# Output:
#   s: stucture containing
#   s.Dx: cell array of the gradient
#   s.D: Laplacian
#   s.sv: structure describing the state vector
#   s.mask: land-sea mask
#   s.WE: diagonal matrix where each element is the surface
#     of a grid cell
