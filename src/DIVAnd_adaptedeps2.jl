    factor = DIVAnd_adaptedeps2(s,fi);

# Input: 
* `s`: structure returned by `DIVAndrun`
* `fi`: analysis returned by `DIVAndrun`

# Output:
* `factor` : multiplicative factor to apply to epsilon2


 Using Deroziers adaptive approach provides a multiplicative factor for the current epsilon2 value so that factor*epsilon2 is a better
estimate of the R matrix. If you cannot use `DIVAndrun` but use `DIVAndgo`, the latter provides automatically this pamater as result.
