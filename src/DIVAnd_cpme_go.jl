# Input:
*  Same arguments as DIVAndrun with in addition
*  `MEMTOFIT=`: keyword controlling how to cut the domain depending on the memory remaining available for inversion (not total memory)
*  `RTIMESONESCALES=` : if you provide a tuple of length scales, data are weighted differently depending on the numbers of neighbours they have. See `weight_RtimesOne` for details


# Output:
*  `erri`: relative error field using the clever poor man's error approach. Result on the same grid as fi.



 ONLY USE THIS VERSION IF YOU CANNOT RUN `DIVAndgo` with `:cmpe` activated (or directly `DIVAnd_cpme` if you can run `DIVAndrun`)
